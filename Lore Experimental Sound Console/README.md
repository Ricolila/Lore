An Open-Source Advanced Sound Design Workstation.

This is where you can compile Lore on your own. You need to download the Lore folder and compile everything in Cabbage (the "IDE" for Csound) http://cabbageaudio.com

Lore isn't simply a synth or effect but a crowd-funded, continuously updated environment for manipulating and processing sounds.

Lore dissects audio into tiny particles that can be stretched, spectrally delayed and surgically altered on very specific frequency bands. From there everything can be modulated for dynamically shifting, constantly-evolving sound sculptures.

Lore is an open-source project, developed by Puremagnetik artist and lead developer Micah Frank and supported by monthly patrons. Much of Puremagnetik's development for the past several years has culminated into experimental sound processing tools. Lore absorbs these tools into a flagship, modular environment.
